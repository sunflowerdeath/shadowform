# Guides / Async Validation

In this example, validation first checks email format
(for simplicity valid email is anything that has `'@'`),
and then checks whether this email is already used.
If you enter the value `test@test`, you will see an error message
that email is already used.

```@render
<AsyncValidationExample />
```

Async validation need to have flag `isAsync: true`,
and validate function should return Promise.

```@source
file: '../examples/AsyncValidationExample.js'
tabs: 4
from: 7
to: 29
lang: 'jsx'
highlightLines: '22'
```
